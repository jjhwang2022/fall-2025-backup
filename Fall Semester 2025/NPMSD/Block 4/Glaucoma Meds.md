Katzung tail end of ch 10

–Be able to describe in detail the “normal regulation” of eye function: ciliary, circular, radial muscle control; the physiologic factors that influence outflow through the canal of Schlemm; and the regulation of aqueous humor production.

–Diagnose the difference in clinical presentations of open angle and closed angle glaucoma.

–Use the various diagnostic tests for both states to confirm diagnosis

–Be prepared to answers questions regarding the pathophysiology of both

–Know the anatomical differences between the two types and how they relate to the diagnosis and management

–Be able to diagnose and prescribe treatments for both.

- Be aware of treatment goals
- Describe in detail the mechanism of action and toxicities of the drugs used to treat glaucoma
- Know drugs that are to be used with caution and why when a patient is suffering from either type of glaucoma.
